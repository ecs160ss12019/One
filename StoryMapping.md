## Sprint 2 Update:

### Sprint 1 Short Summary
After completing Sprint 1 we ended up making a little more progress than we had
initially expected. During the implementaion phase we decided to make a few 
updates to the initial design which was the addition of a few new classes that 
we had not though of during our design phase.

In terms of what we have completed so far we satisfied all of our Sprint 1 
Acceptance Criteria.  

* When I start the game, I see a space ship.
* When I start the game, I see asteroids.
* When I start the game, I see at least 1 UFO.
* When I start the game, I see all objects together.

Additional tasks completed

* The movement of the Space Ship
* Implemented JoyStick feature.
* Spawning of multiple and random (UFOs/Asteroids)


### Changes To Design
* Added AsteroidManager.java class
* Added AsteroidGenerator.java class
* Added UFOManager.java class
